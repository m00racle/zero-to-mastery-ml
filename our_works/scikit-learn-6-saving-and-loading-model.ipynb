    "## 5.  Improving model predictions through experimentation (hyperparameter tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first predictions you make with a model are generally referred to as baseline predictions. The same goes with the first evaluation metrics you get. These are generally referred to as baseline metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your next goal is to improve upon these baseline metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the main methods to improve baseline metrics are from a data perspective and a model perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a data perspective asks:\n",
    "* Could we collect more data? In machine learning, more data is generally better, as it gives a model more opportunities to learn patterns.\n",
    "* Could we improve our data? This could mean filling in missIng values or finding a better encoding (turning things into numbers) strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a model perspective asks:\n",
    "* Is there a better model we could use? If you've started out with a simple model, could you use a more complex one? (we saw an example of this when looking at the [Scikit-Learn machine learning map](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html), ensemble methods are generally considered more complex models)\n",
    "* Could we improve the current model? If the model you're using performs well straight out of the box, can the **hyperparameters** be tuned to make it even better?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Patterns in data are also often referred to as data parameters. The difference between parameters and hyperparameters is a machine learning model seeks to find parameters in data on its own, where as, hyperparameters are settings on a model which a user (you) can adjust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have two existing datasets, we'll come at exploration from a model perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we'll look at how we could improve our `RandomForestClassifier` and `RandomForestRegressor` models through hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "What even are hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good question, let's check it out. First, we'll instantiate a `RandomForestClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's starts with importing the data from CSV format to data frame."
